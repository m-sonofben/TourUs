    <string name="bungee_jump">Bungee jumping is an adventurous sport in which people jump from
        higher ground such as a bridge with an elastic rope tied to their ankles to stop them from
        hitting the ground. The rope is designed to stretch, not break. When the rope has stretched
        all the way, the jumper bounces back up. When people jump they wear safety equipment like
        helmets and a harness.
